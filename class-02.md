What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

The four most important features to look for in text editing would be: code completion, syntax highlighting,
the abiltiy to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available where you need them, and a nice variety of themes.

What do the following commands do?

pwd - this commans is print working directory, it tells you where your current working directory is.

ls - this command is to list the contents of the directory

cd - this command stands for change directory or move to another directory

mkdir - this allows users to create directories

touch - used to create, change, and modify timestamps in the files, or creating a blank file

Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line?
(Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

cd projects - this command would be going to the folder projects  

mkdir new-project -  this scenario would be creating a new file in project folder

touch new-project/newfile.md - creating a blank file in the project folder

cd .. - going back to the root directory

ls projects/new-project - performing a listing to check to see if the new project is in the terminal
